===========

Applying machine learning/text analysis techniques to hip hop lyrics.  More specifically, trying to find the most common words (using inverse document frequency) and the frequent itemsets of these words (using an fp-growth algorithm) across East Coast, West Coast, Midwest, and Southern style hip hop.

provided by my employer, Macadamian Technologies.
